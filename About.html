                <h2>Short Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                   <br> Hello! My name is Jason A. Brito, I am currently 17 years old and I was born in Georgia but I currently live in Indiana.
                    I have a family of eight, both my parents and five of my siblings. I plan on going through a computer
                    science path, as for which college I'm not too sure but I'm still looking.
                </p>

                <h2>My goals/Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    My goals are sort of vague but nonetheless I am still striving to reach them. My goal is to first figure
                    out where I'm going to go after finishing highschool. Also I always want to further my skills in the
                    coding field learning the key languages. I plan joining a successful company in the game design field
                    aftwerwards.
